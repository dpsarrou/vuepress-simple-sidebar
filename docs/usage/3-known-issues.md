1. Are you pointing to the correct url?
   Verify the url and or spelling.

2. Is it a folder with documents but no readme.md file?
   A `Readme.md` file is needed in the folder, if you want to navigate to the
   folder's url. Naturally a folder's url will show the Overview page (and the
   sidebar of course will show all the folder's documents links) but no page
   that shows all folder's content is generated by default.
