# Overview

Architecture Decision Records is an essential documentation for any software
project because they capture the most important architectural decisions, their
context and their consequences. They can be used to understand why some choices
where made, what are the consequences of those choices and check whether the
forces that forced such a choice are still valid to date. If not, maybe its time
for an updated decision that can simplify the codebase.
